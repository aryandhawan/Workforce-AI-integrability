🧪 Observations:
- The model predicts non-attrition cases (0) very well.
- Attrition cases (1) are harder to classify, likely due to class imbalance.
- Precision for attrition class is good (0.70), but recall is lower (0.38), suggesting many false negatives.
- ElasticNet regularization prevented overfitting and helped generalize well.

📌 Insights:
- Employees with higher monthly income and job satisfaction tend to stay.
- Overtime is a strong signal for attrition.
- Short tenure and low work-life balance correlate with attrition risk.

📈 Recommendation:
- Use this model for *risk flagging* — identifying high-risk employees.
- Consider data augmentation or SMOTE for better recall on attrition class.
- Visualize decision boundaries and feature importances for further trust.
